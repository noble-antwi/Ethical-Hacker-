# 1.0.1 Why I’m Taking This Module

## My Journey at Protego Security Solutions

I’m excited to start my journey at Protego Security Solutions, where I’ll be stepping into the world of cybersecurity as an entry-level penetration tester. My enthusiasm for this field was recognized by the recruiter, and now I have the opportunity to learn under the guidance of my mentor, Alex, for the first 90 days.

The goal of this module is to prepare me for real-world penetration testing. I’ll be engaging in various activities designed to quickly build my skills and get me ready for client engagements. We’ll explore key concepts in penetration testing, and I’ll be setting up my practice lab environment to apply what I learn.

I’m looking forward to growing my career at Protego and sharing my progress here.

Before diving into the hands-on aspects of penetration testing, I need to grasp some fundamental concepts. This module will help me understand the difference between ethical and unethical hacking, which is crucial for navigating the cybersecurity landscape. I’ll also learn about the latest threats and attacker motivations, as these are constantly evolving in our field.

Penetration testing is often considered an art, but like any art, it needs to be rooted in a solid methodology. This module will guide me through different types of testing and industry-standard methods. Lastly, I’ll get hands-on experience by setting up a lab environment where I can practice and refine my skills.


## Understanding Threat Actors

Before I can effectively mimic a threat actor as an ethical hacker or penetration tester, it's crucial to understand the different types of threat actors. Here are the most common types of malicious attackers today:

### Organized Crime
Cybercrime has surpassed the drug trade as the most profitable illegal industry, attracting new types of cybercriminals. Organized crime groups are well-funded and motivated, using any and all of the latest attack techniques, such as ransomware or data theft, to monetize their activities.

### Hacktivists
Unlike organized criminals, hacktivists are not motivated by money. They aim to make a point or further their beliefs through cybercrime, often by stealing sensitive data and revealing it to the public to embarrass or financially affect their targets.

### State-Sponsored Attackers
Governments use cyber attacks for espionage and disruption. Cyber war and cyber espionage are key activities in this category. Many believe that the next major conflict could occur in cyberspace, which is why countries like the U.S. consider cyberspace an operational domain that must be defended.

### Insider Threats
Insider threats come from within an organization. These actors can be normal employees tricked into divulging sensitive information or malicious insiders motivated by revenge or money. Understanding these threats helps me see how easily security can be compromised from within.

By recognizing these different threat actors, I can better prepare myself to anticipate and counter their tactics as an ethical hacker.
